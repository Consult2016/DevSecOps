Welcome to the DevSecOps initiative and software repositories.  These repositories are meant to help build a community around DevOps + Security experimentation and lessons intended to help scale and deliver Rugged software.  This is the primary repository to help with understanding the mission and getting involved.

This repository has been created to help security practitioners to understand DevSecOps, how to operate, and how to contribute to this effort.
